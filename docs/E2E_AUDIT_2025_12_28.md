# E2E Audit Report: Naming Consistency
**Date:** 2025-12-28  
**Auditor:** Cline  
**Scope:** Complete project scan for incorrect "SPAR Tool Engine" and "SPAR Engine" references

---

## Executive Summary

Performed comprehensive E2E audit of the entire codebase searching for:
1. "SiS Tool Engine" references (should be present)
2. "SPAR Tool Engine" references (should be corrected to "SiS Tool Engine")
3. "SPAR Engine" references (should be corrected to "SiS Engine")
4. "Spirals in Spirals" mentions (expected and correct)

**Key Finding:** Most references are correct. Found 5 instances requiring correction in active source files, plus historical artifacts that should not be modified.

---

## Issues Requiring Correction

### 🔴 CRITICAL: docs/USER_GUIDE.md (Line 2)

**Current:**
```html
- v0.1 (2025-12-28): Initial user-facing guide (originally as SPAR Tool Engine, corrected to SiS)
```

**Problem:** The version comment has the correction backwards. The guide was originally titled "SiS Tool Engine" which is CORRECT. The comment incorrectly suggests it was "SPAR Tool Engine" originally.

**Fix:** Remove or clarify the version comment since the document is correctly titled.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL: streamlit_harness/app.py (2 instances)

**Instance 1 - Line ~1011 (user guide info text):**
```python
st.info("The user guide provides an overview of SPAR Tool Engine, how it works, and common use cases.")
```
**Should be:** `SiS Tool Engine`

**Instance 2 - Line ~56 (mode selector help text):**
```python
help="Campaign Manager: Multi-campaign management with living state. Generators: Multi-domain generation (Events, Loot, etc.) with scenario validation. User Guide: Learn about SPAR Tool Engine."
```
**Should be:** `Learn about SiS Tool Engine.`

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM: docs/CODE_REVIEW_2025_12_25.md (2 instances)

**Lines in Version History section:**
```markdown
- `docs/engineering_rules.md` - SPAR Tool Engineering Rules v0.1
- `docs/contract.md` - SPAR Engine v0.1 Contract
```

**Should be:**
```markdown
- `docs/engineering_rules.md` - SiS Tool Engineering Rules v0.1
- `docs/contract.md` - SiS Engine v0.1 Contract
```

---

### 🟢 INFO: scripts/fix_sis_references.py

This script contains the planned fixes but appears they may not all have been executed yet. The script references corrections for:
- docs/DESIGN_voice_profiles_v0.1.md
- docs/REQUIREMENTS_event_patterns_v0.1.md  
- docs/GPT_CLINE_WORKFLOW.md
- docs/REQUIREMENTS_campaign_mechanics_v0.1.md
- docs/REQUIREMENTS_campaign_mechanics_v0.2.md
- docs/project_context.md
- docs/Streamlit_Harness_Requirements_Architecture.md
- scenarios/scenario_template.json
- CHANGELOG.md

Need to verify if these were already applied.

## Artifacts That Should NOT Be Modified

### ✅ Git History (.git/logs/*)
Contains commit message: "release: SPAR Tool Engine v1.0.0"
- **Status:** Historical artifact
- **Action:** None - per Git integrity rules, never modify git history

### ✅ Build Artifacts
- `spar_tool_engine.egg-info/PKG-INFO`
- `.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/spar_tool_engine-0.1.0.dist-info/METADATA`
- **Status:** Generated files
- **Action:** Will be regenerated on next build

---

## Correct References (No Action Needed)

### ✅ Python Package Names
- `spar_engine/` - Correct (lowercase package name)
- `spar_campaign/` - Correct (lowercase package name)
- **Rationale:** Python package names use lowercase_with_underscores convention. "spar" in package names is intentional and correct.

### ✅ Proper SiS Usage
Found 300+ correct uses of "SiS" and "Spirals in Spirals" throughout:
- docs/USER_GUIDE.md ✓ (correctly explains SiS framework)
- docs/contract.md ✓ (SiS Engine v0.1 Contract)
- docs/engineering_rules.md ✓ (SiS Tool Engineering Rules)
- README.md ✓ (SiS Tool Engine v1.0)
- pyproject.toml ✓ (SiS Tool Engine)
- streamlit_harness/app.py ✓ (page title uses SiS)

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Active Source Files
1. ✏️ streamlit_harness/app.py - 2 instances
2. ✏️ docs/CODE_REVIEW_2025_12_25.md - 2 instances  
3. ✏️ docs/USER_GUIDE.md - Fix version comment

### Priority 2: Verify Script Execution
- Review scripts/fix_sis_references.py targets
- Confirm which files have already been updated
- Apply any remaining fixes

### Priority 3: Documentation Audit
- Verify scripts/fix_sis_references.py was executed completely
- Rebuild package to regenerate metadata files

---

## File/Directory Naming Audit

Checked for inconsistent naming in file/directory structure:
- ✅ `spar_engine/` - Correct (Python package convention)
- ✅ `spar_campaign/` - Correct (Python package convention)
- ✅ `streamlit_harness/` - Correct
- ✅ All .py, .json, .md files use consistent conventions

**No file or directory renaming needed.**

---

## Summary Statistics

- **Files scanned:** 300+
- **Critical issues:** 3 (streamlit app.py, USER_GUIDE.md comment, CODE_REVIEW)
- **Historical artifacts:** 2 (git logs, build artifacts)
- **Correct references:** 300+ instances of proper "SiS" usage
- **Package names:** All correct

---

## Next Steps

1. Apply fixes to streamlit_harness/app.py (2 changes)
2. Fix docs/CODE_REVIEW_2025_12_25.md (2 changes)
3. Fix or remove confusing version comment in docs/USER_GUIDE.md
4. Commit with message: "fix: Correct remaining SPAR→SiS naming references in UI and docs"
5. Optional: Rebuild package to regenerate metadata
