Each entry must be a situation that forces a choice and implies consequences. Requirements: Use only these tags (hazard, reinforcements, time_pressure, social_friction, visibility, mystic, attrition, terrain, positioning, opportunity, information, cost, threat, heat, consequence, obligation). Use only these environments (confined, populated, open, derelict, industrial, sea, planar). Use only these phases (approach, engage, aftermath). Do not invent new mechanics, tags, or rules. Do not include genre-specific nouns (avoid: orcs, lasers, spells by name). Focus on consequences not resolution. Use neutral phrasing. Severity (1-10) measures instability not importance.",
