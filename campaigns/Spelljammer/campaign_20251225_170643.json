    "### Player Characters\n- Albanus (giff monk)\n- Amolara (human artificer \u201cwitch\u201d)\n- Bryannas (elf arcane archer)\n- Eisira (male eladrin monk), secretly runs a criminal organization based out of the Radiant Citadel\n- Garabi (thri-kreen rogue), on a prophecy quest for a crystal egg\n- Lucky (plasmoid warlock)\n- Magnus (fighter), later revealed as an infiltrator/traitor aligned with the Solstice Pact\n- Tig (kender monk), currently petrified\n- Zefot (kalashtar monk), displaced from Eberron, unknowingly time-flung ~20,000 years forward\n\n### Key NPCs / Powers in Play\n- Biziver (autognome cleric, Twilight/Celestian), linked to the Temporal Guardians, later captured in the betrayal at the Citadel\n- Khalir of the Pale Path (Moonstone Incarnate) and Sylemeth (Amethyst Incarnate), prophetic/vision catalysts\n- Zash\u2019ir (Githyanki swordsage, temporal affinity), an \u201coracle-witness\u201d figure tied to Maker vaults and the Infinite Staircase\n- The Solstice Pact (Astral Elf splinter faction) seeking \u201ctemporal reclamation,\u201d using infiltration and chronomancy, with Magnus as an agent\n- The Makers (a Phirblas offshoot, conceptual glyph-architects) whose hidden systems under/within the Citadel run on intent-driven glyph logic\n\n### Major Artifacts and Mysteries\n- The Chronolens: a powerful temporal vision/observation device; stolen by Magnus + Solstice Pact during the Citadel betrayal\n- Bryannas\u2019s Ring: allows a 1-minute rewind at the cost of 10 years of aging, and ties her to Guardian legacy\n- Infernal Device of Lum the Mad (control lever): in Bryannas\u2019s possession (true function still unrevealed in-play)\n- Star Seeds / Incarnates / Radiant Citadel origin: Star Seed activations can birth Incarnates and reshape worlds, and the Citadel is \u201cthe one that remembered\u201d\n\n### Cosmology Backbone (Myth-Arc Compression)\n- The Spellplague era is treated as a major chronal divergence that helped create \u201cFirst Watchers,\u201d chronally contaminated modrons that eventually become the Temporal Guardians\n- The Temporal Guardians are framed as awakened modrons with time-harmonic capabilities, operating out of Fortress Epoch (partially out of phase with standard reality)\n- The Solstice Pact believes their timeline was pruned or stolen during a Star Seed event, driving their \u201creclamation war\u201d\n- Eberron is long-destroyed; anyone traveling there now would find a desert wasteland suitable for Dark Sun\u2013style adventures (Athas tone)\n\n### Current Situation\n- The party opened a doorway to the Infinite Staircase (as it began to close) at the same moment a massive warforged city-ship appeared over the Radiant Citadel\n- Immediately after, play shifted to an Athas one-shot (Session 10), set in the desert-wasteland era tied to Eberron\u2019s fate\n\n---\n\n## Campaign Ledger (Sessionized History)\n\n### 2025-01-05 \u2014 Session 0 \u2014 Radiant Citadel: Formation and Omens\n- The PCs meet on/around the Radiant Citadel\n- Zefot is singled out by the Amethyst Incarnate and receives the \u201cbranching life-path\u201d boon (visions of diverging futures)\n\n### 2025-01-19 \u2014 Session 1 \u2014 The Blight Job \u2192 Fistandia\u2019s Mansion\n- The party investigates a world/region suffering an accelerating blight\n- Research leads them through a portal into Fistandia\u2019s extradimensional mansion, then onward toward Toril-based clues about ancient curses\n\n### 2025-02-02 \u2014 Session 2 \u2014 Toril: Northern Pilgrimage and the Auril Trap\n- The party travels with pilgrims into the northern wastes, led by Yselm Bloodfang (secretly aligned with Auril)\n- They find Fistandia trapped in a cave by a curse-work/time-dilation survival device\n\n### 2025-02-16 \u2014 Session 3 \u2014 Toril: Battle in the Null-Time Cave, Tig Petrified\n- Yselm reveals her agenda, attacks with powerful allies\n- During/after the fight, a party member is poisoned; Fistandia sacrifices her containment device, fully embraces her curse, petrifies the dying PC to stabilize them, then flees into the world (Tig remains petrified)\n\n### 2025-03-02 \u2014 Session 4 \u2014 Rock of Bral: Ground Crew and the Rogue Comet\n- The party lands at The Laughing Beholder on the Rock of Bral, finds work with a salvage company\n- They pursue a rogue comet fragment containing giant-sized ruins matching Eberron giant motifs\n- They breach a concentric time-slow trap and recover a key Chronolens component (via Bryannas\u2019s ring resonance)\n\n### 2025-03-16 \u2014 Session 5 \u2014 Radiant Citadel: Biziver, the Guardians, and the Lambent Zenith\n- The party meets Biziver, who reveals he helped orchestrate the party\u2019s convergence and confirms Bryannas\u2019s father\u2019s link to the Temporal Guardians\n- Mission: find the missing ship Lambent Zenith, last known to be transporting a critical Chronolens-related piece\n\n### 2025-03-30 \u2014 Session 6 \u2014 The Uncharted Sphere: Ilevathos and the Shipwreck Maelstrom\n- The party finds a small crystal sphere: a wreckage-maelstrom circling the dead god Ilevathos, the Whispering Reliquary\n- They crash onto the god-corpse, find the Lambent Zenith split into three sections, rescue survivors suffering temporal malaise\n- A disguised Death Slaad is exposed and defeated (with help from an ally revealed to be a Couatl), though much of the crew dies\n\n### 2025-04-13 \u2014 Session 7 \u2014 Return to the Citadel: Plans, Then the Betrayal\n- Biziver explains the Guardians have closed normal access routes; the Infinite Staircase may be the only path\n- Magnus betrays the party: stabs Biziver as a signal, Astral Elves attack, higher ranks escape via teleport stones with Biziver, the Chronolens, and many notes\n- The bastion burns; the party recovers Biziver\u2019s message bottle, sends a warning, and finds damaged notes referencing \u201cthe Makers\u201d and a mason\u2019s mark seen around the Citadel\n\n### 2025-04-27 \u2014 Session 8 \u2014 Echoes of the Makers, Part 1: Incarnates and the Archives\n- The party meets Khalir (Moonstone Incarnate) and Sylemeth (Amethyst Incarnate)\n- At the Archives of Reflection, PCs experience personalized vision sequences and gain glyph resonances\n- They learn the Makers are likely a Phirblas offshoot, and Maker glyphs encode concepts, not letters\n\n### 2025-05-11 \u2014 Session 9 \u2014 Echoes of the Makers, Part 2: Maker Tunnels and the Gate\n- A basement collapse reveals hidden access into Maker tunnels beneath Eisira\u2019s HQ\n- The party navigates intent-driven, glyph-activated catacombs toward the mechanism chamber\n- Zash\u2019ir activates the mechanism (using a 1,000 gp fire opal), ejecting an existing Star Seed and birthing/launching a new Star Seed\n- A doorway to the Infinite Staircase appears and begins to close\n- A massive warforged city-ship appears over the Radiant Citadel, casting the city into shadow\n\n### 2025-05-25 \u2014 Session 10 (Current) \u2014 Athas One-Shot: The Glass Spires and the Buried Colossus\nThis session is a side-story in the Dark Sun\u2013toned desert wasteland (Athas feel), tied to the campaign\u2019s Eberron-into-wasteland revelation",
    "The party plays as a four-character one-shot team (separate cast from the main Spelljammer crew)\n- Location focus: the Glass Spires and a partially exposed, ancient colossus structure\n- Key pressure mechanics in play:\n  - Warden Attention clock (how close the region\u2019s \u201cWarden\u201d is to detecting/engaging the team)\n  - Colossus Intel clock (how much actionable understanding the team extracts before the situation collapses)\n- Major encounter anchor: the Cinderstalker Pack in the Glass Spires\n- Tone/structure: exploration-first, escalating pursuit, ending in a planned TPK; any treasure is only relevant inside this one-shot\n\n---\n\n## Future Sessions\n\n### Future Session \u2014 Waking the Guardians Spiral (Projected Session 11)\n- Macro-objective: ascend the Infinite Staircase to reach the Temporal Guardians before the Solstice Pact\n- Expected play: paradox realms, time fractures, and \u201cwhat counts as canon\u201d dilemmas as the party tries to recover the Chronolens and rescue Biziver\n\n---\n\n## Open Threads and \u201cNext Imports\u201d Hooks\n- Recover the Chronolens from the Solstice Pact; determine what they\u2019ve learned/changed with it\n- Rescue Biziver, and recover any stolen notes that decode Makers / Guardians access routes\n- First contact with the warforged city-ship: intent, threat vs refuge, and its tie to Zefot/Eberron\u2019s lost timeline\n- Zefot\u2019s displacement (Eberron \u2192 Radiant Citadel + 20,000 years) and who \u201ctouched\u201d that portal\n- Bryannas\u2019s ring (rewind/age) and how many \u201cten-year minutes\u201d she\u2019ll spend before it breaks her\n- Eisira\u2019s gang as an ongoing power base on the Citadel, destabilized by the bastion fire and new existential threats\n- Star Seed cycle implications: opening a Staircase door appears to have world-scale consequences"
