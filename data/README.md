**Current Version**: v1.1  
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-26

### Version History

#### v1.1 (2025-12-26) - Phase 1 Core Pack Extension
- **Total entries**: 107 events (+42 from v0.1.1)
- **Major expansion**: Tripled content density for richness without new mechanics
- **Distribution**:
  - Approach: 32 entries (30%)
  - Engage: 41 entries (38%)
  - Aftermath: 63 entries (59%)

**New Aftermath Entries (+27)**:
- Batch 1: Core archetypes (reputation, resource echo, environmental memory, narrative drift, obligation)
- Batch 2: Jurisdictional shifts, administrative fallout, social cooling, infrastructure degradation, patient opportunities
- Batch 3: Personal consequences, logistical inertia, moral residue, delayed revelations

**New Engage Entries (+5)**:
- Non-combat escalation focus
- Leverage flips, coordination breaks, contested resources, authority intervention, cascading errors

**New Approach Entries (+10)**:
- Reconnaissance and positioning emphasis
- Watched routes, narrow timing, information gaps, terrain restrictions, negotiated access

**Design Compliance**:
- All entries use existing tags/vectors only (no new mechanics)
- Setting-neutral phrasing maintained throughout
- Consequence-driven without urgency creep
- Context-scalable situations
- Quality bar: approved designer calibration batch

**Impact**: Generator now has 3x content density, significantly reducing repetition and improving perceived intelligence.

#### v0.1.1 (2025-12-25) - Low-Urgency Aftermath Pass
- Total entries: 54 events (+8 from v0.1)
- **Tonal diversification**: Added 8 Aftermath-only entries without time_pressure dependency
- **New entries focus**: Delayed consequences, information revelation, social/political fallout
- **Tag emphasis**: information, opportunity, social_friction, consequence, terrain
- **Severity**: All new entries 1-5 band (mostly 1-3)
- **Expected impact**: Reduce time_pressure dominance in Aftermath from ~60% to ~40%
- **Design goal**: Make Aftermath feel post-conflict vs "late Engage"
- See: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_aftermath_low_urgency.md`

#### v0.1 (2025-12-25) - Initial Aftermath Expansion

#### v0.1 (Initial - 2025-12-22)
- Total entries: 36 events
- Coverage: All presets (confined, populated, open, derelict) for approach/engage phases
- Aftermath: Limited coverage (8 events, uneven distribution)
- Tags: hazard, visibility, time_pressure, reinforcements, attrition, terrain, social_friction, information, opportunity, positioning, mystic

### Content Design Principles

**Situations, Not Facts**: Every entry forces a choice or reveals a tradeoff

**Severity Bands**: Events use overlapping severity bands (1-10) to provide variety across difficulty modes
- High severity (7-10): Compresses decision time, risks cascading fallout
- Medium severity (4-6): Complicates plans, introduces new pressures  
- Low severity (1-3): Adds texture, shifts positioning, seeds future complications

**Tag Diversity**: Multiple tags per event enable rich cooldown interactions and filtering
- 2-4 tags per entry is ideal
- Tags reflect WHY this matters, not WHAT it is

**Phase Semantics**:
- **Approach**: Reconnaissance, positioning, early pressure signals
- **Engage**: Active conflict escalation (combat and non-combat)
- **Aftermath**: Consequence, persistence, redirection (not escalation)

**Setting-Neutral Phrasing**: All entries work across fantasy, sci-fi, noir, horror, post-apocalyptic settings
- Avoid genre-specific nouns
- Describe roles, not names
- Tone from phrasing, not vocabulary

**Environment Coverage**: All core environments supported with balanced content pools

**Quality Bar**: See `docs/REQUIREMENTS_core_pack_extension_v1.1.md` for complete authoring guidelines
