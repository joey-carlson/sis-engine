Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn."

The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.

You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bagÕs color. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag cannot be used again until the next dawn.

Unable to travel and find a new friend, the cube simply sat there and waited for anyone to come along. Anyone seeing the cube would be compelled to be with the cube and have it in their possession. Upon holding the cube, they would feel the need to keep it with them at all times, and protect it as if it were their own child.

When used as a lute, it is considered to be a lute and does not require a separate proficiency bonus to play. However, if the user rolls a critical miss with the weapon (a 1 on an attack roll) the lute may become slightly damaged and will require the user to spend an hour to retune it. If the instrument is not returned, whenever the instrument is played, the user is disadvantaged on the Perform check. This weapon can also be used as a bard's spellcasting focus.

You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bagÕs color. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag cannot be used again until the next dawn.

When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed. Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM determines the time and plane. If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane. Known by name and feared or coveted.",

Doing so turns the creature's flesh into ash and forges its life force into a tooth appropriate for its type which magically binds itself to the amulet.\n\nEach tooth has a type and a property. As a ritual, you can expend one tooth to gain its property for 24 hours or until a new ritual has been performed. Constructs, Oozes, and Plants are unaffected by this item. Undead whose essence you sap grant you a tooth with the type that it possessed in life rather than undeath.\n\n*Aberrations: You can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 ft. that can understand a Language. This form of telepathy doesn't allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond.\n\n*Beasts: Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to twice your level.\n\n*Celestials: As an action, you can touch a target and remove any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness condition.\n\n*Dragons: Your breath weapon gains a recharge of 6 and its damage die is increased to d8.\n\n*Elemental: You choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder and gain resistance to that element.\n\n*Fey: Touching a creature, you magically know the creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a Charisma saving throw, you also know the creature's alignment. Celestials, Fiends, and Undead automatically fail the saving throw.\n\n*Fiends: You gain advantage on saving throws against Spells and other magical effects.\n\n*Giants: Your Strength score is 21. This property has no effect on you if your Strength is already 21 or higher without this necklace.\n\n*Humanoids: You become proficient in any two skills. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.\n\n*Monstrosities: You gain Darkvision 60 Ft. and Tremorsense 60 Ft. In addition, you gain a keen sense of hearing and smelling which grants you advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell."

Several hundred years ago, the Aeger, a giant bear, terrorized hundreds of small villages up and down the Sword Coast. The bear was invulnerable to fire, cold, or acid. Finally the young men and women of several villages banded together, forming a militia almost two hundred people strong. The Aeger was surrounded and finally slain. Less than a dozen villagers survived, and they carved the Aeger's hide amongst themselves. Out of one of the pieces this armor was created. Distinctive enough to be remembered.",

After an hour, the lantern is fully sapient and can parlay with the party. It has a deep desire to burn everything flammable (and can do so), but may be tempered with the promise of being kept alight for longer.\n\nFor the first 30 minutes it provides light at a range of 60/90 ft. This grows by 30 ft for every 30 minutes after. If left on for more than 3 hours the lantern becomes so hot it will set fire to anything flammable in a 5 foot range. It can be extinguished with a command word written on the base of the lantern."
